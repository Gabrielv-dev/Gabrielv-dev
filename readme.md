# Hey, I'm Gabriel Valentin 🚀


I work as a Frond End Developer with UI/UX design skills, I'm based in Bucharest, Romania.<br>


<br>I've had the chance to immerse myself in many different works and projects, helping to make this word a little better through design & code. 😊 🌏 <br><br>


<blockquote>“A user interface is like a joke. If you have to explain it, it’s not that good.”</blockquote><br>


I'm always trying to grow and learn something new, i lose track of time when i'm studying new languages or simply reading a good book. 📚<br>

# What I'm Focusing on 💣

Currently improving my Angular & JavaScript skills.
